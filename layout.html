	width="100" height="125" ALIGN=LEFT>Puerto Escondido, The Mexican Pipeline. Everyone's heard of the place and
	many have given it a try. But how much of the Escondido legend is true and how much is myth? The truth is that 
	Puerto can match its reputation, if you are willing put in the time it takes to know the place.<br>
        First off, the waves. The surf is seasonal, varying from small to medium in size during the dry season (November to April),
        and from small to big during the rainy season (beginning in early May). The change of seasons is dramatic, occurring within
        the space of a week and bringing with it an equally sudden increase in wave size. We encounter our first myth: With the 
        change of seasons--and wave size--wave quality diminishes. Somehow this myth has remained a feature of Puerto's lore when 
        in fact, the quality of Escondido's surf actually increases immediately after the rainy season begins. An added feature 
        during this time of year is that the evening session is often accompanied by strong offshore winds which can result in 
        world class conditions. <br>
